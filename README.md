# The Polaris Dashboards for Apache Devlake
### Open source Grafana Dashboards for Apache DevLake

This repo contains open source dashboards that you can install on [Apache Devlake](https://devlake.apache.org) to get visibility and measure key aspects of your product and delivery process. 

These are the a subset of dashboards we use with clients in [The Polaris Advisor Program](https://polaris-advisor.com). 

Each dashboard comes with a guide on how and when to to use it, and more importantly the  underlying assumptions that you need to take into account when using the data in the dashboard to make decisions. 

We plan to open source more of the dashboards on an ongoing basis so check back occasionally or follow us for updates. 

To import these dashboards into your installation of Apache Devlake edit the json file and replace the name of the MySQL datasource, if you've changed it from the Devlake default (*mysql*).


The dashboards are provided under the same Apache 2.0 license as DevLake and may be used under the terms of the license.
